Had reserved a room in the East Tower, King Bed, High Floor, but when we arrived, there were none available. They put us in a room near the pool, in neither of the towers. Looks like it used to be an old motel that the Sheraton had bought out. The room was cozy, but still, it wasn't what we had reserved. We were told that our stuff would be moved the next day to the room that we had reserved. Came back to the front desk around -:--pm the next day, they had no idea what we were talking about. Had to wait another -.- hours for them to get us our room. Again-- nothing was wrong with the first room, it's just not what we had reserved. The second room, on the -th floor of the East tower was just as nice, furnished the same as the first one, but had a slightly bigger bathroom and a great view of the marina.\\nThis hotel is very isolated, and you won't find a cab ride for less than $-- one way. Even if they charge you for parking, I think that you'll save money to rent a car.\\nThe bar is pretty pricy, as is the restaurant, but the quality of both are good.\\nOverall, we enjoyed our stay at this hotel, but if we visit San Diego again, will probably stay within walking distance to the trolly.\",\n          \"For the location and price, this hotel can't be beat. \\nI had booked our stay months in advance and secured a great rate that included breakfast. As our stay got nearer, I called to confirm things and ask a few questions. I didn't expect any problems but the --- rep said that my rate didn't include breakfast. He was a little curt. I said I had confirmation numbers but he still said that there was no such rate, not wanting to discuss further. I decided to call the reservations manager who took a long few days to return my call. \\nChristine De Guzman, the reservations manager at the hotel turned out to be lovely and accomodating. She honored the breakfast inclusion deal. \\nOur room was bright, cheerful and clean. It was a decent size for the standard room.\\nThe bathroom was not my favorite. It was not bright enough and showing signs of age. I didn't like the smell of the shower curtain and it bothered me the entire stay. I thought that was standard but after peeking in on another room a few doors down, I realized they did have shower stalls with doors!\\nDue to a few side trips to the wine country and Carmel, etc.., we checked in and out a few times. I then requested for a bathroom that had a shower stall. They were happy to oblige. The front desk people were very nice. \\nWe used the indoor pool, hot tub and work out facilities. They were basic, not luxurious, but still nice. There is a small charge that the nice manager allowed me to carry over for our entire stay in SF during the -.- weeks we were there. \\nThe daily Japanese and Western buffet breakfast was plentiful, delicious and totally worth it even if you were paying. I highly recommend it. The selection is extensive. Items are fresh. We really looked forward to breakfast every morning. Hostesses who seated us and the waitstaff who soon became \\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"old friends\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\" were so polite, friendly and helpful.\\nThe concierge desk was great too. Sheena was fabulous. Her restaurant recommendations were spot on. We wanted young, hip, interesting and she delivered! We loved them all. \\nSince we took side trips and later picked our daughter up at camp at Stanford, we had to rent cars. We liked the fact that the Hotel Nikko had an onsite ( Enterprise) car rental agency and was in close proximity to many rental agencies ( for price comparisons) and a parking garage nearby. The hotel parking was outrageous. There are cheaper parking options a few blks away but we didn't feel safe walking back form those locations in the evening. \\nThe location of the hotel was a decent one. Do stop by the concierge desk first to map out where you shouldn't walk. We loved walking everywhere but some turns can take you down scary streets. It was a lovely walk to the Westfield shopping Ctr., Union Sq. and the Financial District- Ferry Bldg.. \\nThe only thing that made me take off a point was the age of the hotel. I think it could stand to have a little freshening up. Otherwise, it was nice and perfect for our length of stay.\",\n          \"Although they are renovating the hotel, our stay was peaceful and quiet. The rooms are clean and spacious, location is perfect, the coffe shop downstairs a delight. We always stay there, we will always stay there. The renovations are excellent and the look will be great.\\nThe staff is very nice and comfy, family like. The price perfect. I highly recommend it and I have stayed everywhere in LA.

Had reserved a room in the East Tower, King Bed, High Floor, but when we arrived, there were none available. They put us in a room near the pool, in neither of the towers. Looks like it used to be an old motel that the Sheraton had bought out. The room was cozy, but still, it wasn't what we had reserved. We were told that our stuff would be moved the next day to the room that we had reserved. Came back to the front desk around -:--pm the next day, they had no idea what we were talking about. Had to wait another -.- hours for them to get us our room. Again-- nothing was wrong with the first room, it's just not what we had reserved. The second room, on the -th floor of the East tower was just as nice, furnished the same as the first one, but had a slightly bigger bathroom and a great view of the marina.\\nThis hotel is very isolated, and you won't find a cab ride for less than $-- one way. Even if they charge you for parking, I think that you'll save money to rent a car.\\nThe bar is pretty pricy, as is the restaurant, but the quality of both are good.\\nOverall, we enjoyed our stay at this hotel, but if we visit San Diego again, will probably stay within walking distance to the trolly.\",\n          \"For the location and price, this hotel can't be beat. \\nI had booked our stay months in advance and secured a great rate that included breakfast. As our stay got nearer, I called to confirm things and ask a few questions. I didn't expect any problems but the --- rep said that my rate didn't include breakfast. He was a little curt. I said I had confirmation numbers but he still said that there was no such rate, not wanting to discuss further. I decided to call the reservations manager who took a long few days to return my call. \\nChristine De Guzman, the reservations manager at the hotel turned out to be lovely and accomodating. She honored the breakfast inclusion deal. \\nOur room was bright, cheerful and clean. It was a decent size for the standard room.\\nThe bathroom was not my favorite. It was not bright enough and showing signs of age. I didn't like the smell of the shower curtain and it bothered me the entire stay. I thought that was standard but after peeking in on another room a few doors down, I realized they did have shower stalls with doors!\\nDue to a few side trips to the wine country and Carmel, etc.., we checked in and out a few times. I then requested for a bathroom that had a shower stall. They were happy to oblige. The front desk people were very nice. \\nWe used the indoor pool, hot tub and work out facilities. They were basic, not luxurious, but still nice. There is a small charge that the nice manager allowed me to carry over for our entire stay in SF during the -.- weeks we were there. \\nThe daily Japanese and Western buffet breakfast was plentiful, delicious and totally worth it even if you were paying. I highly recommend it. The selection is extensive. Items are fresh. We really looked forward to breakfast every morning. Hostesses who seated us and the waitstaff who soon became \\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"old friends\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\" were so polite, friendly and helpful.\\nThe concierge desk was great too. Sheena was fabulous. Her restaurant recommendations were spot on. We wanted young, hip, interesting and she delivered! We loved them all. \\nSince we took side trips and later picked our daughter up at camp at Stanford, we had to rent cars. We liked the fact that the Hotel Nikko had an onsite ( Enterprise) car rental agency and was in close proximity to many rental agencies ( for price comparisons) and a parking garage nearby. The hotel parking was outrageous. There are cheaper parking options a few blks away but we didn't feel safe walking back form those locations in the evening. \\nThe location of the hotel was a decent one. Do stop by the concierge desk first to map out where you shouldn't walk. We loved walking everywhere but some turns can take you down scary streets. It was a lovely walk to the Westfield shopping Ctr., Union Sq. and the Financial District- Ferry Bldg.. \\nThe only thing that made me take off a point was the age of the hotel. I think it could stand to have a little freshening up. Otherwise, it was nice and perfect for our length of stay.\",\n          \"Although they are renovating the hotel, our stay was peaceful and quiet. The rooms are clean and spacious, location is perfect, the coffe shop downstairs a delight. We always stay there, we will always stay there. The renovations are excellent and the look will be great.\\nThe staff is very nice and comfy, family like. The price perfect. I highly recommend it and I have stayed everywhere in LA.

Had reserved a room in the East Tower, King Bed, High Floor, but when we arrived, there were none available. They put us in a room near the pool, in neither of the towers. Looks like it used to be an old motel that the Sheraton had bought out. The room was cozy, but still, it wasn't what we had reserved. We were told that our stuff would be moved the next day to the room that we had reserved. Came back to the front desk around -:--pm the next day, they had no idea what we were talking about. Had to wait another -.- hours for them to get us our room. Again-- nothing was wrong with the first room, it's just not what we had reserved. The second room, on the -th floor of the East tower was just as nice, furnished the same as the first one, but had a slightly bigger bathroom and a great view of the marina.\\nThis hotel is very isolated, and you won't find a cab ride for less than $-- one way. Even if they charge you for parking, I think that you'll save money to rent a car.\\nThe bar is pretty pricy, as is the restaurant, but the quality of both are good.\\nOverall, we enjoyed our stay at this hotel, but if we visit San Diego again, will probably stay within walking distance to the trolly.\",\n          \"For the location and price, this hotel can't be beat. \\nI had booked our stay months in advance and secured a great rate that included breakfast. As our stay got nearer, I called to confirm things and ask a few questions. I didn't expect any problems but the --- rep said that my rate didn't include breakfast. He was a little curt. I said I had confirmation numbers but he still said that there was no such rate, not wanting to discuss further. I decided to call the reservations manager who took a long few days to return my call. \\nChristine De Guzman, the reservations manager at the hotel turned out to be lovely and accomodating. She honored the breakfast inclusion deal. \\nOur room was bright, cheerful and clean. It was a decent size for the standard room.\\nThe bathroom was not my favorite. It was not bright enough and showing signs of age. I didn't like the smell of the shower curtain and it bothered me the entire stay. I thought that was standard but after peeking in on another room a few doors down, I realized they did have shower stalls with doors!\\nDue to a few side trips to the wine country and Carmel, etc.., we checked in and out a few times. I then requested for a bathroom that had a shower stall. They were happy to oblige. The front desk people were very nice. \\nWe used the indoor pool, hot tub and work out facilities. They were basic, not luxurious, but still nice. There is a small charge that the nice manager allowed me to carry over for our entire stay in SF during the -.- weeks we were there. \\nThe daily Japanese and Western buffet breakfast was plentiful, delicious and totally worth it even if you were paying. I highly recommend it. The selection is extensive. Items are fresh. We really looked forward to breakfast every morning. Hostesses who seated us and the waitstaff who soon became \\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"old friends\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\" were so polite, friendly and helpful.\\nThe concierge desk was great too. Sheena was fabulous. Her restaurant recommendations were spot on. We wanted young, hip, interesting and she delivered! We loved them all. \\nSince we took side trips and later picked our daughter up at camp at Stanford, we had to rent cars. We liked the fact that the Hotel Nikko had an onsite ( Enterprise) car rental agency and was in close proximity to many rental agencies ( for price comparisons) and a parking garage nearby. The hotel parking was outrageous. There are cheaper parking options a few blks away but we didn't feel safe walking back form those locations in the evening. \\nThe location of the hotel was a decent one. Do stop by the concierge desk first to map out where you shouldn't walk. We loved walking everywhere but some turns can take you down scary streets. It was a lovely walk to the Westfield shopping Ctr., Union Sq. and the Financial District- Ferry Bldg.. \\nThe only thing that made me take off a point was the age of the hotel. I think it could stand to have a little freshening up. Otherwise, it was nice and perfect for our length of stay.\",\n          \"Although they are renovating the hotel, our stay was peaceful and quiet. The rooms are clean and spacious, location is perfect, the coffe shop downstairs a delight. We always stay there, we will always stay there.
